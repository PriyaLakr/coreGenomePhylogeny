# coreGenomePhylogeny (under development)

Requirements: 

# get_homologues 

[get_homologues](http://eead-csic-compbio.github.io/get_homologues/manual/) package is required for extracting core and pan genomes among different species. 

# MAFFT 

[MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/source.html) is used for generating multiple sequence alignment.

# Super matrix vs super tree approach 


# Sequence matrix 

[Sequnce matrix](http://www.ggvaidya.com/taxondna/) is used for concatenating alignments into a super matrix.

# Phylogeny 

Various tools like [IQtree](http://www.iqtree.org) and [MEGA X](https://www.megasoftware.net) can be used for generating phylogenomic trees. 

# Tree visualization

[iTOL](https://itol.embl.de) is used for tree visualization and editing. [Figtree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) can also be used.
